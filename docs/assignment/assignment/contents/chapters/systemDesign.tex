The upfront steps that were taken to create a shared understanding and to
examine possible solutions in building the application are shortly presented in
the current section.

\subsection{Determination of the Use Cases}
SmartCart in its final scope addresses two main use cases: the use case of
creating a shopping list and adding items to it as well as the process of going
shopping itself. The use case ``Go shopping’’ implements the main user
interaction that consists of switching to the previous / next item and of
marking an item of the shopping list as ‘added to cart’. This interaction takes
place via gestures made by the user with its smartphone and detected by the
SmartCart application.
