The upfront steps that were taken to create a shared understanding and to
examine possible solutions in building the application are shortly presented in
the current section.

\subsection{Use Cases}
SmartCart in its final scope addresses two main use cases: the use case of
creating a shopping list and adding items to it as well as the process of going
shopping itself (see \ref{fig:UseCases}). The use case ``Go shopping''
implements the main user interaction that consists of switching to the previous / next item and of
marking an item of the shopping list as `added to cart'. This interaction takes
place via gestures made by the user with its smartphone and detected by the
SmartCart application.

\subsection{Relations between the captured Gestures
and the used Sensors}

\label{sect:dataModel}
Figure \ref{fig:DataModel} shows a model of how the smartphone, the sensors and
the gestures that should be recognized are related to each other. The
acceleration sensor provides information about the smartphone's speed-up along
its coordinate axes. In the most cases, these axes are not aligned with the
standard x-y-z axes because of the smartphones orientation. Since the
orientation affects the measured acceleration values, it has to be taken into
account when recognizing the user's gestures.

\subsection{Application Context}
The context of the application can be retrieved from figure \ref{fig:context}.
The inputs are the values of the accelerometer $a_x$, $a_y$ and $a_z$ as well as
the angles $azimuth$, $pitch$ and $roll$ that determine the smartphones
orientation. The current state and any other information of the application are
visualized on the smartphone's display.
